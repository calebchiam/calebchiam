### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer at [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) - building tech for public good.

As a student, I worked on conversational NLP and was involved in projects such as [ConvoKit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit), an open-source Python toolkit for conversational analysis, and [Chirpy Cardinal](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/), Stanford's chatbot for the Amazon Alexa Prize Competition. I am also interested in data-centric AI and previously worked at [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/).

### Hi there üëã

I am a Software Engineer at [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) - building tech for public good.

As a student, I worked on conversational NLP and was involved in projects such as [ConvoKit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit), an open-source Python toolkit for conversational analysis, and [Chirpy Cardinal](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/), Stanford's chatbot for the Amazon Alexa Prize Competition. I also worked on data-centric AI previously at [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/), building things like [Cleanlab Studio](https://app.cleanlab.ai) and [Cleanlab Vizzy](https://playground.cleanlab.ai).

In my free time, I play chess ‚ôüÔ∏è badly and unwind with a [20+ year old medieval clicking simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/egbkjc/mfw_people_ask_me_why_i_still_play_a_medieval/) ‚öîÔ∏è.
